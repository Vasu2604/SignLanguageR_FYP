# Important to read before using our model
We use American Sign Language only for test purpose. Aditionally, we have created Indian sign language dataset for our university purpose due to that I am not able to upload ISL dataset in my github. However, anyone can use ISL dataset or any other dataset from kaggle and train and test our model using that data to recognize sign language.
Thank you
